    <p>Super-simple cheesy breadsticks with no dough used. <i>Recipe by Chef John</i></p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>  
    <ul>
        <li>17.5 oz frozen puff pastry (half package)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons freshly shredded parmigiano-reggiano cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of frozen puff pastry dough onto a floured work surface and allow dough to thaw just until it can be unfolded. Unfold dough into a flat sheet; brush top of puff pastry dough with olive oil. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle white cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese onto the dough, covering the surface. Top with a piece of plastic wrap; press cheese and seasonings firmly into the dough with your fingers or by laying a sheet pan onto the dough over the plastic and pressing it down.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic and use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough down the seam lines into thirds; cut each third lengthwise into thirds for a total of 9 breadsticks.</li>
        <li>Pick up a dough strip and place it seasoned side down on to the work surace, and twist from both ends 8 to 9 times to make a rolled tube of dough with the seasoned side out. Place breadsticks onto prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining tablespoon of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over the sticks. Roll the sticks lightly to even up their shapes and pick up and press any dropped cheese onto the surfaces.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about ten minutes; flip and continue baking until breadsticks are browned and crisp, 10 to 20 more minutes. If you pick up a stick by one end and it droops, bake for several more minutes. Cool on wire rack before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
    <p>You can put all kinds of dried herbs and spices, curry powders, smoked paprika, and things like that. I am showing my basic formula and then you will adapt.</p>
    <p>The wider the strips, the more bread-like the cheese sticks will be. The tighter you twist them, the more dense and crisp they will be. A loose twist will result in a softer, breadier stick.</p>

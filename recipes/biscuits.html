        <li>quarter teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons very cold butter, cut into pieces</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk self-rising flour and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add cold butter and cut it into flour with a pastry blender until texture resembles coarse crumbs, 5 to 7 minutes. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a fork just until mixture starts to come together to form a shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured work surface. Press into a roughly shaped rectangle. Fold into thirds using a bench scraper. Press again into a rectangle. Flour surface if the dough begins to adhere to it. Roll dough with a rolling pin to around half an inch thickness. Sprinkle with half of the shredded cheese and half of the green onions. Fold dough into thirds. Dust with flour, if necessary, and roll out again to about half inch thickness. Top with remaing cheese and green onions. Fold into thirds and roll out again to about half inch thickness. Cut biscuits with a 2 to 3 inch biscuit cutter.</li>
        <li>Transfer biscuits to prepared baking sheet. Brush lightly with buttermilk. Sprinkle tops with about a teaspoon of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cooked through and golden brown, for about twenty minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Enjoy, serves around 6.</li>
